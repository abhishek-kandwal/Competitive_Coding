Question :- Can be any string given, we have get the sum of the string. 
but the rules are:- 
    How to perform sum:- 
        1) if the value at the 
            [current_index_value] -> vowel, and
            [the next_index_value] -> consonant 
            then, we'll take the [current_index_value] and can add it to sum.
           BUT,
        2) if the 
            [current_index_value] -> vowel, and
            [the next_index_value] -> vowel
            both index value is vowel then, we'll compare the values as ASCII codes and check 
            who is greater and add it.
   EXAPMPLE:-
        given:
           1) string = "aegu"
            then, 
                 we'll consider
                      Sum(e + g + u) 
            2) string = "fjwoefjlsflsf
            then, 
                 we'll consider
                      Sum(w + o + s)
